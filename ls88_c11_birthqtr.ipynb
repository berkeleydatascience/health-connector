    "<h1>Class 11: Quarter of birth and maternal characteristics</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "A tradition in the applied economics literature of the past several decades has been to look at an individual's outcomes across different quarters of birth. The most basic idea is that because most state laws require compulsory schooling until a particular age in years, whether it's 16, 17, or 18, teens who were born during the winter typically are of dropout age while children born during the summer or early fall were not. If children born at different times of the year were in fact otherwise identical or indistinguishable from one another, then compulsory schooling laws might force some children to have more education than others, and social scientists might be able to learn something by comparing those two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buckles and Hungerman (2013) looked at maternal characteristics and found that they varied over the year as well, which calls into some question the canonical findings that children born during the winter are different because their own educational attainment can be less than that of children born during the summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a subset of the data that Buckles and Hungerman mustered in support of their argument. In particular, let's look at Census records from the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Censuses.  In each case, these subsamples are of mothers with coresident children 17 or under, and each record contains the mother's characteristics alongside the birth quarter and year of the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run this model repeatedly with ordinary least squares (OLS):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = \\alpha \n",
    "+ \\beta_2 bq2_i\n",
    "+ \\beta_3 bq3_i\n",
    "+ \\beta_4 bq4_i\n",
    "+ \\gamma \\tilde{by}_i\n",
    "+\\epsilon_i \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y_i$ is a characteristic of the mother, the $bq$ variables are 0/1 indicators of the child's birth quarter, and the $by$ variable is a linear measure of the child's birth year.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have subtracted the average birth year in the sample from $by$ to produce the measure $\\tilde{by}$ that appears in the equation.  I did this so that the constant term $\\alpha$ would report to us a recognizable average $Y$ rather than a function of it and $\\gamma$ times the birth year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that I have <b>omitted</b> *bq1* from the equation. When you have indicator variables that together cover 100% of the sample, you either must drop one and thus designate it as the \"default\" category that receives just the constant term, or you must omit the constant term. Buckles and Hungerman choose to omit *bq1*, so let's do the same here.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Why is this? Imagine if it weren't the case. Then to whom is the constant term $\\alpha$ applicable? Everyone? Then everyone gets $\\alpha$ plus their $\\beta$. But what would prevent us from subtracting a tiny number from each $\\beta$ and adding it to $\\alpha$? Or doing that, and then doing it again? Nothing would, and that produces an indeterminacy that isn't good. We must drop one of the indicators or the constant term, which pins down the estimates and gets us out of indeterminacy.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Omitting *bq1* gives us a very convenient set of hypothesis tests:  the $\\beta$'s are the additional bits that mothers of children NOT born in the first quarter get. Our hypothesis is that these are all zero:  $\\beta_2 = \\beta_3 = \\beta_4 = 0$. We will find in many cases that we can reject the null; in fact, there are differences in mother's characteristics by quarter of birth."
